  Four Step Process
  1.  Add  "springdoc-Openapi-ui" Maven Dependency  .
  2.  Add the configuration
        2.1 : add the configuration in application.properties
        2.2 : add the Bean by creating the @cofiguration  java class file.
  3.  Add the annotations  to the controller classes
  4.  Add the documents  for structure.


 Step 1 :    Add  "springdoc-Openapi-ui" Maven Dependency  .
                     <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
                        <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-ui</artifactId>
                        <version>1.6.11</version>
                    </dependency>
            After adding this dependency you  got the swagger documentation in your  application to access that you
            have to open the  with http://localhost:port/context-path/swagger-ui/index.html
            But the issue is it will show all the document specification with default details like who is the user,
            description, ... to update and change that you have to follow the step 2 .

 Step 2 :  Add the Configuration
           2.1 : To update the  default swagger-ui url  you have to give the  url in the application.properties file.

            springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/openapi/swagger-ui.html
            springdoc.api-docs.path=/openapi/v3/api-docs
            springdoc.packagesToScan=com.asbnotebook.example.controller
            springdoc.pathsToMatch=/**

            all the  properties start with the "springdoc" and after that its functionality base name like

            springdoc.swagger-ui.path= /openapi/swagger-ui.html
                        use to define the  default path  to access the  swagger document
            springdoc.api-docs.path=/openapi/v3/api-docs
                        using the api-doc.path we will get the swagger documentation in the json format

            springdoc.packagesToScan=com.eAuction.seller.controller
                        using this packageToScan we defined what are the package are allowed to scan to generate the
                        api specification document.

            springdoc.pathsToMatch=/**
                        using this pathsToMatch  filer the path of the api and only those api pass this match only there
                        api document will get generate.

           2.2 : add the Bean by creating the @cofiguration  java class file.
            To define the  Information about the api document like what is the title ,description version .contact,
            termOfService and licence you have to create @Bean  for the OpenAPI and return the  new OpenAPI() which have
            Info object that contains all the above fields details.


 Step 3 :  Add the  @ annotation to the  api method  we have multiple annotation  some of the common annotation are given
           below -
           1. @Tag : class level annotation
           2. @Operation : use to customise the  name and description of the API
           3. @ApiResponses : define all the possible apiResponse
           4. @ApiResponse : define one response at at time
           5.
